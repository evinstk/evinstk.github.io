title: Player Character Goals
permalink: /s2-pc-goals

Good goals are **(1) achievable,** **(2) have consequences for failure,** are **(3) fun to pursue,** and are **(4) diverse** (though a character's short-term goal can also advance their long-term goal). Keep these criteria in mind as we refine these goals.

## Open questions
- **Cody/Casey**: Is Gonzalo open about his association with the Cerberus Assembly? Given that Dust suspects the Assembly is responsible for her family's death, if Dust learns that he's a former member, that would arouse suspicion.
- **Cody**: Who did you know at the Cerberus Assembly? Any villains, friends, or remaining contacts?
- **Dani/Cody**: What is the nature of Zora's power and Gonzalo's magical experimentation? We know these things:
  - Gonzalo takes an interest in Zora because he believes her power could be related to his experimentation.
  - Zora fears her power might attract unwanted attention from the Cerberus Assembly.
  - Zora's power makes her good at rogue stuff.
  - Gonzalo suspects the magical chaos in the Savalirwood could advance his experiments.
- **Casey/Dani**: What's the job you two are engaged in? Why do you need muscle (Nelson)? Why bring a wizard (Gonzalo) along?
- **Casey/Dani**: Do your characters have another short-term goal at the moment? It may or may not advance their long-term goals. (My recommendation would be for it to not be related to your long-term goalâ€”maybe something that illustrates your respective personalities instead.)
- **Casey**: What are the circumstances behind Dust's family's death, and what does Dust know now? Feel free to include details that Dust doesn't know yet, or leave some details unknown that I can fill in as the DM for a surprise.
- **Nelson**: What's the lead you're pursuing? What would Zora and/or Dust (as seedy underbelly connections) know that would bring you closer to finding your wife or tracking the official?
- **Nelson**: Who is the official that exiled your wife? We could make them a villain NPC.
- **Nelson**: What's your wife's name? :)
- **Nelson**: What was your experience at war like?

## Dust Damron (Casey) Goals
**Long-term.** Dust's family was wiped out when she was young. She doesn't know the exact circumstances of her family's death, but she is certain the Cerberus Assembly is involved. She wants to know more about what happened by learning more about the Assembly. Maybe she learns of a family legacy, or maybe she uncovers some conspiracy.

> How can we achieve this goal concretely, and what would it mean for Dust to fail? At this point, if she doesn't learn more about her family circumstances, nothing much changes for her. I think we need a specific next step here and more details on what Dust knows currently.

**Short-term.** Dust and Zora are working a job because that's what they do. They're criminals and they love it.

> Just need to know what the job is here and I think the rest of the criteria will follow!

**Short-term.** [Second short-term goal here.]

## Zora Raresmoke (Dani) Goals
**Mid-term.** Zora has a mysterious power that makes her an exceptional thief. She seeks to harness it and to unlock its potential. Uncovering its secrets will likely mean traveling outside Shadycreek Run, but she suspects the Cerberus Assembly or other nefarious factions covet her power for their own ends.

> Need more details on the nature of the power and what next steps are to harnessing it. Make sure it aligns with what Cody is thinking for Gonzalo's magical experiments.

**Short-term.** Dust and Zora are working a job because that's what they do. They're criminals and they love it.

> Just need to know what the job is here and I think the rest of the criteria will follow!

**Short-term.** [Second short-term goal here.]

## (Nelson) Goals
**Long-term.** After returning from the war, Nelson discovered that his wife had been exiled by a local Blumenthal official after she spurned his advances. Nelson wants revenge, whatever form that may take, and to find his wife.

**Short-term.** Nelson is pursuing leads of his wife's whereabouts in Shadycreek Run and looking for accomplices for his revenge plot against the official.

**Short-term.** Nelson supports himself by doing jobs for the Grudge Gang, the local muscle in Shadycreek Run. He wants to complete his assignments so he can feed himself and continue his mission.

## Gonzalo (Cody) Goals
**Long-term.** Gonzalo was expelled from the Cerberus Assembly for conducting unauthorized magical experiments. He fled to Shadycreek Run to lay low and also to investigate the nearby Savalirwood, which to this day is still corrupted by dangerous magics. He believes this magic can advance his experiments.

Gonzalo knows that the Cerberus Assembly is the real instigator behind the war, whispering their ill wishes to King Dwendal. Overtly, he seeks to bring down the Assembly so that the war may come to an end, but his ulterior motive is simply to perform his restricted magic in peace.

> Need more details on the nature of the experiments and what your plans are. If your experiments have something to do with Zora's power, what's the relationship?

**Short-term.** Gonzalo wants to explore the Savalirwood in order to discover its arcane secrets to further his magical experiments.

> What can we achieve here that will move Gonzalo to his long-term goal?

**Short-term.** Gonzalo wants to aid Dust in her job so that she will assist him in his Savalirwood expedition.

## Opening scenario
- The Grudge Gang has assigned Nelson a job to be muscle for whatever small-time plot Dust and Zora have cooking.
- Dust and Gonzalo have already come to an arrangement such that if Gonzalo helps Dust with her job, then Dust will help Gonzalo explore the Savalirwood.
- Our first scenario will likely revolve around completing the small-time job Dust and Zora have planned, so any creative ideas and details about the job from anyone will help flesh out our first session.
